# Protocol 3305: A Standard for People-First Software

**Version 1.0.0**

## Preamble

In an era where personal data has become the most valuable commodity, a dangerous paradigm has emerged: surveillance capitalism. Mainstream software, often offered for "free," is architected to monitor, analyze, and monetize the very people it claims to serve. This paradigm erodes digital dignity, compromises personal security, and creates an unacceptable power imbalance between corporations and individuals.

**Protocol 3305** is an open, non-negotiable standard designed to dismantle this paradigm.

It provides a set of auditable, technically verifiable principles for any organization, developer, or collective that is committed to building software that respects and protects the person behind the screen. This is not a list of suggestions; it is a declaration of architectural and ethical commitments.

Adherence to this protocol signifies that a service is structurally incapable of exploiting its users, because it is built on a foundation of zero-knowledge and zero-trust.

## Article 0: Ethical Monetization - A Pact Against Exploitation

The monetization of personal data is strictly forbidden under this protocol. Software compliant with Protocol 3305 must never treat the person or their data as a product. The business model must be decoupled from surveillance.

Recommended funding models that respect these principles include, but are not limited to:

1.  **Donations and Sponsorships:** Funding from the community and organizations that believe in the mission.
2.  **Premium Features (Ethical Freemium):** Offering the core, secure product for free, with optional, non-essential features available for a fee. **Security must never be a premium feature.**
3.  **Enterprise or Business Versions (B2B):** Providing paid licenses, dedicated support, or self-hosted solutions for businesses, thus funding the free product for all people.

## Pillar I: Architectural Foundation - Engineered for Safety

This pillar ensures that the very blueprint of the software is built for security, not as an afterthought.

#### Art. 1: Privacy by Design
Privacy must be integrated into the fundamental architecture of any compliant system. Each application shall be designed from the ground up to minimize data collection and maximize the protection of people.

#### Art. 2: Security by Default
Compliant solutions must be delivered with the highest security settings enabled by default. People should not need to be experts to be protected; the protocol ensures that safety is the standard state, not an option.

#### Art. 3: Zero Trust
All systems must operate under the premise "never trust, always verify." The architecture shall not implicitly trust any actor, internal or external. Access to resources must be granted granularly and be continuously validated.

## Pillar II: Data Sovereignty - The Person's Kingdom

This pillar establishes the person as the sole sovereign of their data. The service provider is a custodian of encrypted, unreadable data, not its owner.

#### Art. 4: Zero Knowledge
Compliant applications must be engineered so the service provider has zero knowledge of the content people create, store, or transmit. All user-generated content must be end-to-end encrypted, with decryption keys accessible only to the person, not the server.

#### Art. 5: Zero Personal Data Collection
No personally identifiable information (PII) shall be collected, logged, or stored for purposes other than the absolute functioning of the service (e.g., an account email). The system must be structurally unable to possess information that could profile or track a person.

#### Art. 6: Zero Activity Logs
There shall be no logs of a person's activity, IP address, session times, or other metadata that could be used to track their behavior.

---

## Pillar III: Integrity and Guarantees - Verify, Don't Trust

This pillar ensures that all claims of security and privacy are not just promises, but verifiable facts.

#### Art. 7: Open Source
Transparency builds trust. The source code of compliant applications must be open for public audit, allowing the global community of experts to verify, validate, and contribute to their security.

#### Art. 8: Zero Non-Essential Permissions
Applications must only request permissions that are absolutely essential for their core functionality. This principle of least privilege ensures no possibility of abuse through unnecessary access.

## Adopting the Protocol

To declare your project as compliant with Protocol 3305, you must ensure it adheres to all articles defined above. We encourage you to add the following badge to your project's README file.
