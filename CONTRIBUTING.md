Thank you for your interest in contributing to Protocol 3305! Your input is valuable in making this standard robust, clear, and effective. We welcome contributions in the form of suggestions, clarifications, typo fixes, and implementation examples.

## How to Contribute

The best way to contribute is by opening an issue or a pull request on the official [Protocol 3305 GitHub repository](https://github.com/ObscuritySecurity/protocol-3305).

### 1. Opening an Issue

If you have a suggestion, a question, or have found a potential ambiguity or loophole in the protocol, please **open an issue**.

- **Be Clear and Descriptive:** Provide a clear title and a detailed description of your suggestion or concern.
- **Reference Articles:** If your issue relates to a specific article (e.g., "Art. 4: Zero Knowledge"), please reference it.
- **Propose a Solution:** If possible, propose a change to the wording or a new article to address the issue.

### 2. Submitting a Pull Request

For direct improvements like fixing typos, clarifying language, or adding examples to `IMPLEMENTATION.md`, you can submit a pull request.

1.  **Fork the repository.**
2.  Create a new branch for your changes (e.g., `git checkout -b fix-typo-in-article-5`).
3.  Make your changes to the relevant file(s).
4.  Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message.
5.  Push your branch to your fork.
6.  Open a **Pull Request** against the `main` branch of the official repository.

## Guiding Principles for Contributions

- **Maintain Clarity:** The protocol should be understandable by both technical and non-technical audiences. Avoid overly complex jargon where simpler terms suffice.
- **Uphold the Spirit:** All proposed changes must align with the core spirit of the protocol: empowering people and minimizing the power of the service provider.
- **Focus on Verifiability:** Changes should ideally make the protocol's articles more technically verifiable and less open to subjective interpretation.
